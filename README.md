# Japanese Font Subsetter

> An easy way to make a subset from a Japanese font.

## Setup

```shell
$ pipenv install
```

## Usage

Put your font files into the `src` directory and just run: `pipenv run ./generate.sh`.

If you want to customize which glyph to include in the subset, edit the `chars.txt`.
